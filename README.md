# k8s-music-stack

k8s specs for Icecast, mpd, ympd, sima - based on https://github.com/vitiMan/docker-music-stack

This class was initially built for the [Software Freedom School](http://www.SoFree.us). Greetz out to SFS, ASG, IT/NTL and RP!

v1: minikube
v2: AWS and DigitalOcean

Modifications have been made to the `icecast` container for the purpose of configuring via environment variables. 

To get started with this course, open the HTML file (AWS or DigitalOcean version) in your favorite browser. This is a single-file wiki doc using [tiddlywiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/). Links to tiddlers will open within the file, external links will open in a new tab/window. 

There is a slide deck included as a visual guide - but it not necessary for anyone following along outside of a scheduled class. 

Found a problem? Feel free to submit a PR ;)

Happy kube'ing!
